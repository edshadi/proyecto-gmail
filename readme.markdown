Proyecto Gmail:
==============================

- clone the repo
- go to chrome -> extensions
- make sure "Developer mode" is checked
- click Load unpacked extensions
- choose the project folder
- reload gmail
- you should see a sidebar (occasionally we have to wait for gmail, so this might take couple of reloads. We'll fix it later)
